/*
 No Loops Allowed

You will be given an array (a) and a value (x). All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value, without using a loop.

Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either. Return true if the array contains the value, false if not. With strings you will need to account for case.

const check = (a,x) => a.includes(x);
