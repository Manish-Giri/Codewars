"""
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, except in C, where, to keep the difficulty at the level of the kata, you are given two parameters, the first a buffer with length exactly the same as the second parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
